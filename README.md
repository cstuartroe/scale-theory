A lot of work was done on this project before I finally decided it was too large
in scope to continue living with my other miscellaneous small projects. For its
git history prior to the first commit of this repo, see 
[here](https://github.com/cstuartroe/misc/tree/master/Python/31EDO).

### Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```
python main.py
```

It'll open a command prompt interface. Type `help` to see available commands. You can enter any command followed by `--help` to get usage tips for that command.
