A lot of work was done on this project before I finally decided it was too large
in scope to continue living with my other miscellaneous small projects. For its
git history prior to the first commit of this repo, see 
[here](https://github.com/cstuartroe/misc/tree/master/Python/31EDO).

### Set up

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To generate infographics

```
python infographics.py
```

It'll create three images, `intervals.png`, `trichords.png`, and `tetrachords.png`. `trichords.png` and `tetrachords.png` are currently kinda janky.
